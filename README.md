### Instructions to Run the Program as a Linux Service
To run the Go program as a Linux service, you need to create a `.service` file for `systemd` and configure it to manage the service.

### Steps to Set up the Service
#### 1. **Build the Go Application**
First, make sure to compile the Go application into an executable binary:

```shell
go build -o light-stack-connector main.go
```

#### 2. **Move the Binary**
Move the compiled binary to a location suitable for system services, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
sudo mv light-stack-connector /usr/local/bin/light-stack-connector
```

#### 3. **Create a Systemd Service File**
Create a `.service` file in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory. Use the following command to create and edit the service file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/light-stack-connector.service
```

Add the following configuration to the file:
```shell
[Unit]
Description=WebSocket Service to Keep Connection Alive
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/light-stack-connector
Restart=always
Environment=GOROOT=/path/to/go GOPATH=$HOME/go

# Logging location (optional but recommended)
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=light-stack-connector

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Replace with the actual path to your Go installation if needed. `/path/to/go`

#### 5. **Start the Service**
Start the WebSocket service using the `systemctl` command:
```shell
sudo systemctl start 1. **light-stack-connecto**
```
#### 6. **Enable the Service on Boot**
To ensure the service starts automatically on system boot, enable it:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable 1. **light-stack-connecto**
```
#### 7. **Check Service Status**
You can check the status of your service to see if itâ€™s running properly:

```shell
sudo systemctl status 1. **light-stack-connecto**
```

#### 8. **View the Logs**
To view logs generated by your service, use the `journalctl` command:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u 1. **light-stack-connecto** -f
```
